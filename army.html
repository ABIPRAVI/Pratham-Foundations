                <h3>Major Vijay Chauhan - RAW</h3>
                <p><span style="font-size: 40px;">V</span>ijay Chauhan tried to clear NDA exams but he failed many times
                    as he didn't have enough money he couldn't get a good
                    coaching. Then he came to us and we coached him by our expert teachers. As he got good coaching he
                    cleared the NDA.
                    Now after a few years of service he is working as a Major in the Indian army.
                    He regularly donates 10% percent of his salary to our trust
