                <h3>Christopher - IT Professional</h3>
                <p><span style="font-size: 40px;">C</span>hristopher is a son of a daily wages worker and he wasted one
                    year without
                    studying due to his
                    family background. He
                    approached us on requesting to pay his school fees. We recognized this young talent and helped him
                    to cope up with his
                    higher studies.
